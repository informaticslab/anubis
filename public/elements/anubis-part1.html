<p> Only one cause is to be entered on each line of Part I. Additional lines should be added between the printed lines when necessary. For clarity, do not use parenthetical statements and abbreviations when reporting the cause of death. The underlying cause of death should be entered on the lowest line used in Part 1. The underlying cause of death is the disease or injury that started the sequence of events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the fatal injury. In the case of a violent death, the form of external violence or accident is antecedent to an injury entered, although the two events may be almost simultaneous.

<b>
Line (a) immediate cause</b>
</p>
<p>
In Part I, the immediate cause of death is reported on line (a). This is the final disease, injury, or complication directly causing the death. An immediate cause of death must always be reported on line (a). It can be the sole entry in the cause of death section if that condition is the only condition causing the death.
</p>
<p>
The <i>mechanism</i> of death (for example, cardiac or respiratory arrest) should NOT be reported as the immediate cause of death as it is a statement not specifically related to the disease process, and it merely attests to the <i>condition</i> or <i>fact</i> of death. Therefore, the mechanism of death provides no additional information on the cause of death.
</p>
<p>
<b>Lines (b), (c), and (d) due to (or as a consequence of)</b>
</p>
<p>
On line (b) report the disease, injury, or complication, if any, that gave rise to the immediate cause of death reported on line (a). If this in turn resulted from a further condition, record that condition on line (c). If this in turn resulted from a further condition, record that condition on line (d). For as many conditions as are involved, write the full sequence, one condition per line, with the most recent condition at the top, and the underlying cause of death reported on the lowest line used in Part I. If more than four lines are needed, add additional lines (writing ‘‘due to’’ between conditions on the same line is the same as drawing an additional line) rather than using space in Part II to continue the sequence. The following certification is an example in which an additional line was necessary. 
</p>
<p>
The words ‘‘due to (or as a consequence of),’’ which are printed between the lines of Part I, apply not only in sequences with an etiological or pathological basis and usually a chronological time ordering, but also to sequences in which an antecedent condition is believed to have prepared the way for a subsequent cause by damage to tissues or impairment of function. If the immediate cause of death arose as a complication of or from an error or accident in surgery or other medical procedure or treatment, it is important to report what condition was being treated, what medical procedure was performed, what the complication or error was, and what the result of the complication or error was.
</p>
<p>
<u>In the case of neoplasms:</u><br/>
When indicating neoplasms as a cause of death, include the following: 
<ol>
  <li>primary site or that the primary site is unknown, </li>
  <li>benign or malignant, </li>
  <li>cell type or that the cell type is unknown, </li>
  <li>grade of neoplasm, and </li>
  <li>part or lobe of organ affected.</li>
</ol>
For example, a primary well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, lung, left upper lobe. 
</p>

<p>
<u>In the case of fatal injury:</u><br/>
For each fatal injury (for example, stab wound of chest), always report: 
<ol>
  <li>the trauma (for example, transection of subclavian vein), and </li>
  <li>impairment of function (for example, air embolism) that contributed to death. </li>
</ol>
</p>



<p>
<u>In the case of an organ system failure:</u><br/>
If an organ system failure such as congestive heart failure, hepatic failure, renal failure, or respiratory failure is listed as a cause of death, always report its etiology on the line(s) beneath it (for example, renal failure due to Type I diabetes mellitus). 
</p>

<p>
<b>Approximate interval: Onset to death</b>
</p>


<p>
Space is provided to the right of lines (a), (b), (c), and (d) for recording the interval between the presumed onset of the condition (not the diagnosis of the condition) and the time of death. This information should be entered for all conditions in Part I. This information is useful in coding certain diseases and also provides a useful check on the accuracy of the reported sequence of conditions. 
</p>
<p>
These intervals usually are established by the physician on the basis of available information. In some cases the interval will have to be estimated. The term ‘‘approximately’’ may be used. General terms, such as minutes, hours, or days, are acceptable, if necessary. If the time of onset is entirely unknown, state that the interval is ‘‘unknown.’’ Do not leave these items blank.
