		<!-- <span class="section-title">General Instructions for Completing Death Certificates</span> -->
		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>It is essential that the certificate be prepared accurately. Funeral directors are responsible for completing most of the information on the death certificate with the assistance of an informant who is usually a family member.
			</p>
			Completing a death certificate involves the following guidelines:
			<ul>
			<li>Use the current form or electronic system designated by the State.</li>
			<li>Complete each item, following the specific instructions for that item.</li>
			<li>If not certifying electronically, make the entry legible. Use a computer printer with high resolution or print legibly using permanent black ink.</li>
			<li>Do not use abbreviations except those recommended in the specific item instructions.</li>
			<li>Obtain all signatures; rubber stamps or other facsimile signatures are not acceptable. If jurisdiction provides, authenticate electronically.</li>
			<li>Do not make alterations or erasures.</li>
			<li>File the original certificate or report with the registrar. Reproductions or duplicates are not acceptable.</li>
			<li>Refer problems not covered in these instructions to the State office of vital statistics or to the local registrar.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Most States require that the death certificate be completed and filed within a specified time period. To determine the cause of death, physicians are expected to use: 
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>their medical training and knowledge of medicine,</li>
			<li>available medical history, including symptoms and diagnostic tests, and</li>
			<li>autopsy results, if available.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Generally, it is possible to file a certificate with the cause of death listed as pending or pending further study. This is especially useful when additional investigation such as autopsy results are expected, but it obligates the attending physician to update the original information after the additional information becomes available.
