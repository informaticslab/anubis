		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>This section must be completed by either the attending physician, the medical examiner, or the coroner. The cause of death section, a facsimile of which is shown below, follows guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization. As can be seen, the cause of death section consists of two major parts: <b>the direct cause of death (Part I)</b> and <b>other significant conditions contributing to death (Part II)</b>. An important feature is the reported <b>underlying cause of death (lowest line in Part 1)</b> determined by the certifying physician and defined as:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or</li>
				<li>The circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the fatal injury.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In addition to the underlying cause of death, this section provides for reporting the entire sequence of events leading to death (Part I), as well as other conditions significantly contributing to death (Part II).

			<p>
				Part I is for reporting the sequence of events leading directly to death, proceeding backwards from the <b>immediate cause (a)</b>, the final disease or injury resulting in death, to the underlying cause of death (lowest line in Part I), the disease or injury that initiated the chain of events that led directly and inevitably to death. So each condition in Part I should cause the condition above it. A specific cause of death should be reported in the last entry in Part I so there is no ambiguity about the etiology of this cause or any question as to why it developed. In other words, the reported underlying cause should not be the result of another condition. For example, sepsis is not specific because a number of different conditions may have resulted in sepsis, whereas human immunodeficiency virus syndrome is specific. Other significant conditions that contributed to the death, but did not lead to the underlying cause given in Part I, are reported in Part II.
			</p>

			<p>
				In certifying the cause of death, any disease, abnormality, injury, or poisoning, if believed to have adversely affected the decedent, should be reported. If the use of alcohol and/or other substance, smoking history, a recent pregnancy, injury, or surgery was believed to have contributed to death, then these conditions should be reported. The conditions present at the time of death may be completely unrelated, arising independently of each other or they may be causally related to each other, that is, one condition may lead to another which in turn leads to a third condition, and so forth. Death may also result from the combined effect of two or more conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to Parts I and II, there are questions relating to autopsy, tobacco use, pregnancy, manner of death, and injury. The cause of death should include information provided by the pathologist if an autopsy or other type of postmortem examination is done. For deaths that have microscopic examinations pending at the time the certificate is filed, the additional information should be reported as soon as it is available. If the physician has any questions about the procedure for doing this, he or she should contact his or her State registrar. 

			</p>
			<p>
				The cause of death section is designed to elicit the opinion of the medical certifier. Causes of death on the death certificate represent a medical opinion that might vary among individual physicians. Regardless, a properly completed cause of death section provides an etiologic explanation of the order, type, and association of events resulting in death. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For statistical and research purposes, it is important that the causes of death and, in particular, the underlying cause of death be reported as specifically and as precisely as possible. Careful reporting leads to statistics for both underlying and multiple causes of death (i.e., all conditions mentioned on a death certificate) that reflect the best medical opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every cause of death statement is coded and tabulated in the statistical offices according to the latest revision of the International Classification of Diseases. When there is a problem with the reported cause of death (e.g., when a causal sequence is reported in reverse order), the rules provide a consistent way to select the most likely underlying cause. However, it is better when the physician reports the causes in the correct order, rather than imposing assumptions about what the physician meant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Statistically, mortality research focuses on the underlying cause of death because public health interventions seek to break the sequence of causally related medical conditions as early as possible. However, all cause information reported on death certificates is important and is analyzed.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the sections that follow, more detailed instructions on how to complete Parts I and II, as well as the rest of the cause of death section, are given. Some common problems are also discussed. In addition, a number of case histories with examples of properly completed certificates are provided to illustrate how the cause of death should be reported.
