    <span class="section-paragraph">

<p><b>Part I</b> is for reporting the sequence of conditions or events leading directly to death. It begins with the <b>immediate cause (a)</b>, the final disease or injury resulting in death, and proceeds backwards to the <b>underlying cause of death (lowest line used in Part I)</b>, which is defined as: 
</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or</li>
        <li>the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the fatal injury.</li>
      </ul>


<p>Each condition in Part I should cause the condition above it. A facsimile of Part I is displayed below.</p>

<p>A <i>specific</i> underlying cause of death should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I so there is no ambiguity about the etiology of this cause or any question as to why it developed. In other words, the reported underlying cause should <u>not</u> be the result of another condition. For example, sepsis is not specific because a number of different conditions may have resulted in sepsis, whereas human immunodeficiency virus syndrome is specific. Other significant conditions that contributed to the death, but did not lead to the underlying cause given in Part I, are reported in Part II.</p>

<p>For clarity, do <u>not</u> use parenthetical statements and abbreviations when reporting the cause of death.</p>

<b>
Line (a), immediate cause</b>
</p>
<p>
In Part I, the immediate cause of death is reported on line (a). This is the final disease, injury, or complication directly causing the death. An immediate cause of death must always be reported on line (a). It can be the sole entry in the cause of death section if that condition is the only condition causing the death.
</p>

<p>
The <i>mechanism</i> of death (e.g., cardiac or respiratory arrest) should <u>not</u> be reported as the immediate cause of death as it is a statement not specifically related to the disease process, and it merely attests to the <i>condition</i> or <i>fact</i> of death. Therefore, the mechanism of death provides no additional information on the cause of death. The immediate cause of death is the condition that directly preceded and led to the cardiac or respiratory arrest in the decedent.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<b>Lines (b), (c), and (d), due to (or as a consequence of)</b>
</p>
<p>
On line (b) report the disease, injury, or complication, if any, that gave rise to the immediate cause of death reported on line (a). If this in turn resulted from a further condition, record that condition on line (c). If this in turn resulted from a further condition, record that condition on line (d). For as many conditions as are involved, write the full sequence, one condition per line, with the most recent condition at the top, and the underlying cause of death at the bottom. If more than four lines are needed, writing "due to" between conditions on the same line is the same as adding an additional line and is acceptable. Do <u>not</u> use the space in Part II to continue the sequence in Part I.
</p>
<p>
The words "due to (or as a consequence of)," which are printed between the lines of Part I, apply not only in sequences with an etiological or pathological basis and usually a chronological time ordering, but also to sequences in which an antecedent condition is believed to have prepared the way for a subsequent cause by damage to tissues or impairment of function.

      When reporting drug-related deaths, always specify the substance or substances involved. If multiple drugs are involved, be sure to name each drug. Verify the spelling of the name of each drug. If applicable, specify the drug, not a metabolite of the drug. For example, avoid reporting morphine by itself, but instead indicate heroin or pharmaceutical morphine as appropriate. If a specific drug could not be determined, report the class of drug, if possible. Avoid broad terms like "drug," "medicine," "multidrug," "polysubstances," or "polypharmacy," if possible. In the case of a drug overdose or poisoning, the medical examiner or coroner should be contacted.

      Dementia may be reported as the underlying cause of death in Part I or as a contributing cause in Part II.  When reporting dementia as a cause of death, please specify the type of dementia (e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia, etc.).  Even if the diagnosis is not definitive, if a specific diagnosis is suspected or likely, then it is appropriate to qualify the diagnosis as "possible," "probable," or "presumed."

      Diabetes mellitus may be reported as a cause of death, either as one of the direct causes of death in Part I or as a contributing cause of death in Part II.  When indicating diabetes as a cause of death, specify whether Type I (and whether immune-mediated or idiopathic), Type II, gestational diabetes, monogenic diabetes (and whether neonatal diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY]), or some other specific type of diabetes, if possible.

<p>
<b>Approximate interval: Onset to death</b>
</p>


<p>
Space is provided to the right of lines (a), (b), (c), and (d) for recording the interval between the presumed onset of the condition (not the diagnosis of the condition) and the time of death. This information should be entered for all conditions in Part I. 
</p>
<p>
These intervals usually are established by the physician on the basis of available information. In some cases the interval will have to be estimated and the term "approximately" may be used. General terms, such as minutes, hours, days, or years, are acceptable, if necessary. If the time of onset is entirely unknown, state that the interval is "unknown." Do <u>not</u> leave these items blank. 
</p>
<p>This information is useful in coding certain diseases and also provides a useful check on the accuracy of the reported sequence of conditions.
