		<H1>Guidelines</h1>
		
<p>Death certificates are permanent legal records from which official copies
are made. It is essential that the certificate be prepared accurately. Funeral
directors are responsible for completing most of the information on
the death certificate with the assistance of an informant who is usually a
family member.
</p>
Completing a death certificate involves the following guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Use the current form designated by the State.</li>
<li>Complete each item, following the specific instructions for that item.</li>
<li>Make the entry legible. Use a computer printer with high resolution,
typewriter with good black ribbon and clean keys, or print legibly using
permanent black ink.</li>
<li>Do not use abbreviations except those recommended in the specific
item instructions.</li>
<li>Verify with the informant the spelling of names, especially those that
have different spellings for the same sound (Smith or Smyth, Gail or
Gayle, Wolf or Wolfe, and so forth).</li>
<li>Refer problems not covered in these instructions to the State office of
vital statistics or to the local registrar.</li>
<li>Obtain all signatures; rubber stamps or other facsimile signatures are
not acceptable. If jurisdiction provides, authenticate electronically.</li>
<li>Do not make alterations or erasures.</li>
<li>File the original certificate or report with the registrar. Reproductions
or duplicates are not acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most States require that the death certificate be completed and filed within
a specified time period. Physicians are expected to use medical training,
knowledge of medicine, available medical history, symptoms, diagnostic
tests, and autopsy results, if available, to determine the cause of death.
Generally, it is possible to file a certificate with the cause of death listed as
pending or pending further study. This is especially useful when additional
7
investigation such as autopsy results are expected, but it obligates the
attending physician to update the original information after the additional
information becomes available.
