The infant decedent should have a clear and distinct etiological sequence for cause of death, if possible. ‘‘Prematurity’’ should not be entered without explaining the etiology of prematurity. Maternal conditions may have initiated or affected the sequence that resulted in infant death, and such maternal causes should be reported in addition to the infant causes on the infant’s death certificate (e.g., hyaline membrane disease due to prematurity, 28 weeks due to placental abruption due to blunt trauma to mother’s abdomen). 
</p>
<p>
When Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is suspected, a complete investigation should be conducted, typically by a medical examiner or coroner. If the infant is under 1 year of age, and no cause of death is determined after scene investigation, review of clinical history, and a complete autopsy, then the death can be reported as SIDS. Refer to the <i>Medical Examiners’ and Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting</i> for more information.
