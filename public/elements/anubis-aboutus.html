			The Mortality Statistics Branch (MSB) is a part of the National Vital Statistics System at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services. It is the mission of NCHS to provide accurate, relevant, and timely statistical information to inform policies aimed at improving the health of the American people. The MSB collaborates with vital registration systems within various jurisdictions throughout the United States to collect, process, and analyze mortality data for the population, including geographic, demographic, and cause of death information. This data is used to determine the characteristics of those dying in the United States and to calculate mortality rates and life expectancies. The deidentified data are released to the public and used to publish reports on mortality on a regular basis.
