<p>A 92-year-old male was found dead in bed. He had no significant
medical history. Autopsy disclosed minimal coronary disease and generalized
atrophic changes commonly associated with aging. No specific cause
of death was identified. Toxicology was negative. 
</p>

<i>
Notes:<br/>
In some cases, no overwhelming cause presents itself. It is acceptable
to indicate that a thorough investigation was performed; however, no cause
could be determined
